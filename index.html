          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Recently I passed my AWS Solutions Architect Examination with a score of 940/1000. I realized that during my preparation
            I could have saved a lot of time if I knew what the right things to do were. Sure there are a lot of amazing online courses, which I do recommend.
            I have also listed some in the resources section. But if you don't wish to spend much and yet get the same hands on experience and some interesting mini-projects, you can use this.
            I have compiled a list of free sources online which you can use in order to complete this certification within a month. </p>
  
          <h2>Description of the Exam and type of Questions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The examination mainly tests whether you actually had 1+ years of experience in AWS as it expects. Most of the questions combine multiple AWS services.</li>
            <li>The questions involve real time scenarios where you are your ability to provide a highly available,scalable, fault tolerant website. </li>
            <li>Sample Question: In a virtual Private Network, with a public and private subnet, where would you deploy load balancers, web servers and database servers, for higher security.</li>
            <li>A lot fo questions are aimed at your ability to migrate a client's on premise infrastructure to AWS as per his requirement and suggesting best practices in security.</li>
            <li>This exam has two versions SAA C01 and SAA C02. SAA C01 is valid until July 1st. It is the retiring version and has all the core AWS concepts. SAA C02 is the basically
              C01 with additional concepts (HPC, Active Directory Integration and more). 
            </li>
            <li>To clarify, SAA C01, is still valid, and while the exam can only be taken until July 1st 2020, the certification lasts for 3 years from the time you took the exam. The common misconception
              is that the certificate itself expires on the 1st of July which is not true.
            </li>
            <li>Writing the SAA C01 examination covers all the core AWS services ( most of them at least), so that you can suggest solutions at an associate level and make intelligent decisions for 
              the deployment of a product. It is challenging since there is a lot of services to learn.
            </li>
          </ul>
  
          <h2>Resources</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>PAID COURSE: <a href="">Stephaane Maarek Udemy Solutions Architect Course</a> is one of the most sought after. I personally used this one and really enjoyed his content. That being said,
            it alone will not suffice. This course will serve as a baseline. </li>
            <li>PAID COURSE: <a href="">Linux Academy Course</a> is an expensive course with a lot of good content, but has not gone deep into the new exam. SAA C02. </li>
            <li>Other PAID COURSES: <a href="">A Cloud Guru, Whiz Labs,TutorialsDojo, AWS ACADEMY (official)</a>  are known to be good courses, but I have not had experience with any of them.</li>
            <li>Though the above courses give a good hold on the concepts with a lot of hands on, it's not compulsary to spend on the courses to clear the examination. 
              One can do the exam very well even without the courses and with a lot of hands on and reading.</li>
            <li> The below free resources are important and are compulsary even if you have taken one of the above courses. The above courses only provide a foundation. Actual reading of the 
              documentation, FAQs, whitepapers(not all but a select few) are very important. From a pure examination perspective you might feel this is overkill, but I feel that it will make you well prepared to score well.
              <ul>
                <li><a href="">TutorialsDojo CheatSheets</a></li>
                <li><a href="">AWS WhitePapers</a></li>
                <li><a href="">AWS FAQs</a></li>
                <li><a href="">AWS ONLINE TECH TALKS youtube</a></li>
                <li><a href="">Edureka AWS Tutorials Youtube channel</a></li>
  
  
              </ul>
            </li>
  
            <li>PAID Practice Tests: <a href="">Jon Bonso Practice Tests</a> these practice tests are great, that so many people have claimed that this exams difficulty is close to the actual 
            Solutions Architect examination. I did take this , and STRONGLY RECOMMEND that you choose to buy this. But if you do not wish to spend on it, that is fine. You can gain experience using the free tests available online.</li>
            <li>PAID Practice Tests: <a href="">Neal Davis</a> much harder than the actual exam. If you do perform well in this one, it indicates that you are very proficient with the concepts and will ace the exam for sure. Not necessary, but if you have funds
            to spend this is a good option.</li>
  
          </ul>
